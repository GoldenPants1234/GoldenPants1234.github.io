                The missile knows where it is, because it also knows where it isn't. 
                Where it is is a function of where it isn't. To calculate where the missile is, 
                it subtracts where it should be, from where it is not. This results in a remainder.

                The missile cannot receive an external rating. This would conflict because of how it
                is. Instead, it needs an internal rating. To achieve this, it rates itself using a
                function of how it is, subtracted from how it isn't. This results in a remainder that
                equates to what it is lacking, and can be used to calculate what it isn't lacking.
